\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclu}

In conclusion, hyphal extension rate and moisture tolerance are positively related to the decay ability of a fungi isolate as well as the community. In a fungi community, the decay ability is determined by its community-weighted hyphal extension rate. The composition of a fungi community in homeostasis can be inferred from Markov chain model or solving adaptive LV-model.

Environmental conditions have affect on the composition of the community, hence alters the decay ability. The larger the varying range of local environmental condition is, the slower the decomposition becomes. Certain species combinations may suitably persis in corresponding climate. In general, biodiversity is positively related to the decay ability. In short term, the fluctuation of environmental conditions may affect the fungi community intensively, however, in long term, the community will reach a new homeostasis.
