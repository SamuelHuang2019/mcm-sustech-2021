## Linear Programming

[Linear programming (`linprog`)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html#linear-programming-linprog)

- Can only **minimize** a linear objective function, that is, to find the maximum, an additional negative sign is
  required.

- Convert the restrictions to **less than**

- An upper bound in total, an equality in total, a range for each individual variables.
